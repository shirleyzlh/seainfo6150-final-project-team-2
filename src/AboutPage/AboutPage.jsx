      This is the About page
      <br />
      Seattle Technological University is known for the excellence of our
      education, the beauty of our setting, our gifted faculty, and the
      uniqueness of our campus culture.
      <br />
      A Transformative Educational Experience <br />
      Every year, some 2,400 of the world’s top undergraduate students are
      challenged to exceed their own highest personal and intellectual
      expectations. The mastery our graduates demonstrate across the
      professional and vocational spectrum, and the influence they wield—whether
      in their own communities or on the world stage—is testament to a
      singularly empowering undergraduate experience.
      <br />
      Our lively academic community places a high value on rigorous, probing
      inquiry, and creative, cross-discipline thinking. Its collaborative
      approach to scholarship encourages students to question, debate, and
      refine their points of view, not only with each other, but with our
      world-class faculty—often by working directly with them on groundbreaking
      projects.
      <br />
      Seattle Technological University's education fosters the highest standard
      of readiness for the “real world” in its graduates, in terms of ability to
      think, act, and contribute meaningfully and effectively in their chosen
      areas of interest.
      <br />
      The “Full-Engagement” Advantage
      <br />
      Our full-engagement academic philosophy extends to the running of the
      College itself. The student voice is central to decision-making here;
      students serve on major committees of the Board of Trustees, participate
      in faculty search, and contribute to strategic planning.
      <br />
      Students participate in a wide range of extracurricular projects: The
      College and its surrounding community and the greater Seattle area offer
      hundreds of internships, advocacy projects, and the rare advantages of
      being a vital member of the single largest academic “hotspot” in the
      country.
      <br />
      Expected to be fully engaged while here, students carry this sense of
      purposeful involvement and personal commitment throughout life.
      <br />
      A Widely Envied Campus Environment
      <br />
      The sheer sense of scale of the breathtaking natural environment, in which
      buildings are thoughtfully sited, distinguish our physical setting in the
      classically Northwest town of Seattle, Washington.
