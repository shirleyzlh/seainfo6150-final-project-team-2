      This is the About page
      <p>
        We are known for the excellence of our education, the beauty of our
        setting, our gifted faculty, and the uniqueness of our campus culture.
      </p>
      <p>A Transformative Educational Experience</p>
      <p>
        Every year, some 2,400 of the world’s top undergraduate students are
        challenged to exceed their own highest personal and intellectual
        expectations. The mastery our graduates demonstrate across the
        professional and vocational spectrum, and the influence they
        wield—whether in their own communities or on the world stage—is
        testament to a singularly empowering undergraduate experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our lively academic community places a high value on rigorous, probing
        inquiry, and creative, cross-discipline thinking. Its collaborative
        approach to scholarship encourages students to question, debate, and
        refine their points of view, not only with each other, but with our
        world-class faculty—often by working directly with them on
        groundbreaking projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our education fosters the highest standard of readiness for the “real
        world” in its graduates, in terms of ability to think, act, and
        contribute meaningfully and effectively in their chosen areas of
        interest.
      </p>
      <p>The “Full-Engagement” Advantage</p>
      <p>
        Our full-engagement academic philosophy extends to the running of the
        College itself. The student voice is central to decision-making here;
        students serve on major committees of the Board of Trustees, participate
        in faculty search, and contribute to strategic planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students participate in a wide range of extracurricular projects: The
        College and its surrounding community and the greater Seattle area offer
        hundreds of internships, advocacy projects, and the rare advantages of
        being a vital member of the single largest academic “hotspot” in the
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expected to be fully engaged while here, students carry this sense of
        purposeful involvement and personal commitment throughout life.
      </p>
      <p>A Widely Envied Campus Environment</p>
      <p>
        The sheer sense of scale of the breathtaking natural environment, in
        which buildings are thoughtfully sited, distinguish our physical setting
        in the classically Northwest town of Seattle, Washington.
